Rodent Video Tracking Software

Overview:
The Rodent Video Tracking Software is a cutting-edge web application designed to automate the tracking and analysis of rodent behavior in both live and recorded video experiments. Developed to integrate seamlessly into laboratory environments, this software employs advanced computer vision techniques to provide an automated, efficient, and highly reliable solution for behavioral studies.

Key Features:

Real-Time Tracking: Detect and track rodent movements in live or pre-recorded videos, supporting up to four rodents simultaneously in distinct environments.
Behavior Identification: Automatically identifies behaviors such as staying still or nose poking, with the ability to dynamically expand the behavior list based on research needs.
Data Analysis: Offers comprehensive metrics and supports comparisons between manual scoring and system-generated results.
Visualization: Features trajectory visualizations and heatmaps to facilitate in-depth analysis of rodent movements.
User Management: Supports multiple user roles including Admin, Researcher, and Lab Technician, each with specific responsibilities and permissions.
Technologies:

Languages: Python
Framework: Django
Libraries: OpenCV for real-time image processing
Database: Oracle
Operating Systems: Compatible with Windows 10 and above, as well as Ubuntu Linux

Purpose:
The software aims to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of rodent behavioral experiments by replacing manual tracking methods with a fully automated solution. This system not only increases the accuracy of behavioral analysis but also significantly reduces the time and effort involved in traditional methods.

Audience:
This software is primarily designed for researchers and lab technicians involved in neuroscientific and behavioral studies requiring precise and consistent tracking of rodent activities.
